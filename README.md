In 1983, Douglas R. Hofstadter, author of *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid* wrote a series of articles on Lisp in
Scientific American (later republished as the book *Metamagical Themas*).
The third and last in the series was an entertaining example
which is an instructive example on blurring the line between code and
data, which is typical for Lisp (though somewhat less common in
Clojure, except for the occasional macro).
