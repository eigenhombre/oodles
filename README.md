In 1983, Douglas R. Hofstadter, author of *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid* wrote a series of articles on Lisp in
Scientific American (later republished as the book *Metamagical Themas*).
The third and last in the series was a short, entertaining program
which is an instructive example on blurring the line between code and
data, which is typical for Lisp (though somewhat less common in
Clojure, except for the occasional macro).

for a (semi) [literate
implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
with more details.  All credit belongs to Dr. Hofstadter; any errors are mine alone.
